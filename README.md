## My Journey in DSA
Welcome to my tech journey! This repository serves as a reflection of my ongoing growth and learning in the field of data analysis at Digital Skill-Up DSA-Incubator's Hub, where I received a solid, hands-on foundation in both Excel and SQL, and I'm continuously expanding my skillset.
## Phase 1: Excel – Building the Foundation

My journey began with Microsoft Excel, where I developed a strong understanding of data handling, cleaning, and visualization. At DSA-Incubator's Hub, I was trained to: 
* Use 60+ Excel functions including IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and more
* Apply conditional formatting to highlight key insights
* Create and interpret PivotTables for data summarization
* Design interactive dashboards for visual storytelling
* Clean and prepare raw data for analysis

These skills helped me appreciate the power of data, even in its simplest form, and sparked my interest in diving deeper into analytics.

## Phase 2: SQL – Working with Databases
After Excel, I advanced into Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with and manage relational databases. Through hands-on practice, I learned to:

* Query data using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING
* Perform table joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) for relational analysis
* Write subqueries and nested logic
* Extract and filter insights from large datasets

Even the errors I encountered (like syntax mistakes) became valuable learning opportunities as I honed my analytical thinking. Data analytics is indeed a critical thinking process.

## Tools & Skills So Far
* Excel: Data cleaning, advanced formulas, PivotTables, dashboards
* SQL: Data querying, joins, aggregations, subqueries
  Presntly using MSSQL
* Soft Skills: Problem-solving, critical thinking, and a growth mindset
* Current Focus: Power BI, Google Data Analytics Certificate, project portfolio building

The Journey has been demanding and exciting at the same time. All I can say is that I find what motivates me and keep pushing.

## What’s Next?
I'm continuing my journey with the following goals in mind:

* Learn Power BI for creating interactive and impactful dashboards
* Start building a personal portfolio of real-world data projects
* Complete Google’s Data Analytics Certificate for industry-recognized proficiency
* Learn the basics of Python for data analysis
* Collaborate with the data community through open-source or community-driven projects
* Be an instructor

# Final Thoughts
Thanks to the structured and practical training at DSA-Incubator's Hub, I’ve grown from a curious beginner into a confident and evolving data analyst. Every function I write, every query I run, and every dashboard I build brings me closer to mastering the language of data.
